  <p style="text-align: left;  margin-left: 8%; margin-right:8%; margin-top:0;">
      Thank you for your interest in this study. You are being invited to participate in a research study about human perception of rhythm. 
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how synchronization of brain rhythms with the rhythms of sounds influences what we hear. 
      The purpose of this letter is to provide you with information required for you to make an informed decision regarding participation in this research. 
      It is important for you to understand why the study is being conducted and what it will involve. 
      Please take the time to read this carefully.

  <h3 style="text-align: left;margin-left: 8%;margin-bottom: 0;">Study procedure</h3>
  <p style="text-align: left;  margin-left: 8%; margin-right:8%; margin-top:0;">
    The experiments conducted as part of this study will test how humans hear when they listen to auditory rhythms (including music and speech). 
    If you agree to participate, you will be asked to listen to rhythmic sounds. You will be asked to press a specific key if you detect an interruption in the 
    played rhythmic sound. It is anticipated that the entire task take 
    about 60 minutes if you continuously and actively go through all steps. Before the testing starts, we will familiarize you with 
    the setup and your task. At the end of the experiment, you will be referred to a Prolific page where you will see a message confirming that you have successfully completed the experiment.
