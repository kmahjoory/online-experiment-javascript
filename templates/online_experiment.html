        <h1>Welcome to Our Online Experiment!</h1>

        <p>Thank you for your interest in participating in our study. The experiment consists of three parts:</p>
        
        <h2>1. Training</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The training section will guide you through the task step by step using animations.</li>
            <li>Feel free to run the training as many times as you like until you are comfortable with the task.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Practice Trials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In this section, you will practice trials similar to those in the main experiment.</li>
            <li>After each response, the correct answer will be displayed. Please use this opportunity to improve your understanding of the task.</li>
            <li>Your responses in this section will not be saved. You may practice as many times as you wish.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Main Experiment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This part will begin with a few questions about your age, gender, handedness, and music experience. This information is essential for our research.</li>
            <li>You will then perform the task in four blocks. Each block will take approximately 12â€“13 minutes, so the entire main experiment will take about 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>You may take a short break after each block, but pausing within a block is not possible.</li>
            <li>Your responses will be saved and will contribute to our research only if you complete the entire experiment.</li>
        </ul>
